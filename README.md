# CS-at-GSU
This Repo contains a mix of Homework, Projects, and Solved problems I have worked on during my pursuing of a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at Georgia State University. I started in Spring 2018 and should be graduating in the Summer of 2020. Not too bad for a chemist who changed to computer science while having no prior coding experience.
